# MobxTest Mobile Application created to learn how to build an application.

## Windows environment 

## Installation

* **Install NodeJS** - version `v14.8.0`. Link for it: (https://nodejs.org/dist/). 
Check version after installing: `node -v`
Add the paths to the `node.exe file` to the Path variable: `C:\Program Files\nodejs`

* **Install Yarn** -  Command for Power Shell: `npm install --global yarn`

Check version after installing: `yarn -version`

* **Install Microsoft Visual Studio** - Link for it: (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) including the `"Desktop development with C++" workload`. It fixed problem with `node-gyp` during `npm install` 
command: `npm install -g node-gyp`.

* **Install Chocolatey** - if it is not install with Nodejs 
To check the possibility of running scripts from third-party manufacturers, enter the command: `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
By default, the use of third-party scripts is blocked `(Restricted)`. Allow the execution of third-party scripts with the command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`
The execution of the command will require confirmation, we answer with the symbol `A (Yes to All)`.

~ Now you can use third-party scripts. Install the Chocolatey package manager with the following command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
